            <p>In my free time, one of my favorite things is spending quality time with my family.
                Our favorite game to play together is cards. I also enjoy a variety of activities. 
                From sports, I like competitive games like bowling and swimming, which I do once a month or during my summer break.
                Additionally, I love sitting back and watching a good basketball game from time to time.</p>

                    <p>Initially, I disliked swimming and was afraid of it, but my father coached me well, and now I enjoy it. For those who hate or fear it, I encourage you to face your fears and enjoy the experience.</p>

                    <p>I recently started watching volleyball, and it's a great way to relax. I'm a fan of the Japanese team—they have excellent teamwork and made history by finishing second place last year.</p>

            <h2>Future Plans</h2>
            <p>Looking ahead, there are several things I would love to do. One of my top goals is to travel more, which I haven’t been able to do often because of school. There are many places on my bucket list, and I hope to visit them soon. Another goal is to learn a completely new language. This has been a plan of mine for a while, and I hope to achieve it in the near future.</p>
