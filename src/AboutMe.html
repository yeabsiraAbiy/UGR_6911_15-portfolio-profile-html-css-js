            <h2>Short Biography</h2>
            <p>Ever since high school, I've been passionate about technology, especially after developing my first webpage with friends and watching TV programs about coding and computers. This early exposure made it easy for me to choose my major in university. Currently, I am pursuing a degree in Software Engineering at Addis Ababa University, where I have been immersed in learning everything from coding fundamentals to advanced software engineering concepts.</p>

            <p>One of my mentors used to say, "Coding is just the beginning. To truly thrive as a programmer, one must embrace continuous learning, adapt to evolving challenges, and excel in collaboration with a team." Over the years, I've embraced this philosophy, continually improving my skills in problem-solving, teamwork, consistency, and communication.</p>
